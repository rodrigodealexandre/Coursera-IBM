            Hi, I'm Rodrigo Alexandre. <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            My career is marked by a drive for excellence, efficient management, and continuous improvement. I possess superior organizational skills, attention to detail, and a strong professional ethic. As a leader and team member, I inspire others and serve as a role model. I am passionate about fostering strong team commitments and facilitating learning and development through knowledge sharing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I provide consulting services in software development, laboratory workflow organization, and the implementation of tests and methodologies. I have worked at Propósito Digital, supporting the implementation of digital products in the Genesis project, integrating Genomika/Einstein and Fleury, significantly contributing to one of the most impactful projects in the sequencing industry. At Look4Gene, I identified business opportunities with international suppliers of preventive genetic tests and led two development teams as a Product Owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previously, I worked as Operations and R&D Manager at Diagnósticos do Brasil (DB) through X-Mol, leading the creation of an NGS laboratory from scratch. My role covered a wide range of responsibilities, from administrative management and benchwork to bioinformatics and the release of results. I also served as R&D Coordinator, Technical Manager, and NGS Specialist at Genomika/Einstein, one of the pioneering companies in sequencing diagnostics in Brazil. In this position, I was responsible for the validation and training of the medical staff for analyses in the Rare Genomes project and was one of the ideators in the development of the company’s internal software, as well as Varstation (VarsOmics) prior to its incorporation into the Einstein startup group and subsequently as a Product Owner. My career is marked by efficient workflow management, leading software developments, and innovations in NGS analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical expertise is underpinned by a Ph.D. in Health Sciences, focusing on molecular biology, human genetics, and statistics, with a sandwich scholarship for NGS and bioinformatics studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Additionally, I hold an Executive MBA in Management, with an emphasis on Leadership and Innovation, am a Specialist in Data Science, a Practitioner and Master in Neuro-linguistic Programming (NLP), a Green Belt in Six Sigma, and I am always eager to continuously update myself with courses.<br>

            <h3>SwiftKey like Predicting Text</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In this project, we received a text dataset of English origin and were tasked to create an app capable of predicting the next possible word. The functionality of the app should resemble that of the <a href="http://swiftkey.com/en/" target="_blank">SwiftKey</a> app. The app is developed in R and converted to Shiny.
              The aim of this project was for a capstone project to cultivate a data scientist's mindset. Therefore, we were expected to learn how to acquire, clean, explore, interpret, develop workarounds, apply logical reasoning, write code, enhance predictive accuracy, reduce computational runtime and model complexity, and finally, present our final findings.
              To view my final app, please visit the link <a href="https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/predictive_text_model/" target="_blank">https://rodrigodealexandre.shinyapps.io/predictive_text_model/</a>. My condensed milestone report can be downloaded from here, and the full version with the codes can be found here.

            <ul>
              <li>I am constructing a Django app project that handles the creation of document templates so they can be filled out and stored in a database. This document handler has components like "title," "text box," "dynamic table," and other preconfigured fields that can be chosen from a list to create the template. Later on, a user can select the templates to fill and create SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) like documents.</li>
