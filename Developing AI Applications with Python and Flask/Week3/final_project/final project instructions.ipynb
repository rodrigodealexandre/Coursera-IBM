    "## Final Project: AI-Based Web Application Development and Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimated Time: 1 hour 45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "---\n",
    "You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this final project, you will be assessed on the knowledge gained on all aspects of app creation and its web deployment throughout this course. You will be required to save screenshots of your results from time to time, with specific nomenclature. These screenshots will have to be uploaded in the peer graded assignment that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project guidelines\n",
    "---\n",
    "For the completion of this project, you'll have to complete the following 8 tasks, based on the knowledge you have gained through the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This platform is not persistent. It is recommended that you keep a copy of your code on your local machines and save changes from time to time. In case you revisit the lab, you will need to recreate the files in this lab environment, using the saved copies from your machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks and objectives:\n",
    "---\n",
    "* Task 1: Clone the project repository\n",
    "* Task 2: Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library\n",
    "* Task 3: Format the output of the application\n",
    "* Task 4: Package the application\n",
    "* Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application\n",
    "* Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask\n",
    "* Task 7: Incorporate Error handling\n",
    "* Task 8: Run static code analysis\n",

    "1. For this project, you'll use the **Emotion Predict** function of the Watson NLP Library. For accessing this function, the URL, the headers, and the input json format is as follows.\n",

    "    URL: 'https://sn-watson-emotion.labs.skills.network/v1/watson.runtime.nlp.v1/NlpService/EmotionPredict'\n",

    "\n",
    "3. In the `emotion_detection.py` file, write the function to run emotion detection using the appropriate Emotion Detection function. Name this function `emotion_detector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Assume that that text to be analyzed is passed to the function as an argument and is stored in the variable `text_to_analyze`. The value being returned must be the `text` attribute of the response object as received from the Emotion Detection function.\n",

    "4. Take a screenshot of the code you write and save it as `2a_emotion_detection.png`.\n",
