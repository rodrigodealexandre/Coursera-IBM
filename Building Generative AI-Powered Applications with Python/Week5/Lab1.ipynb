    "## Build a Chatbot for Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will create a chatbot for your own pdf file using Flask, a popular web framework, and LangChain, another popular framework for working with large language models (LLMs). The chatbot you develop will not just interact with users through text but also comprehend and answer questions related to the content of a specific document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the demo link below to try the final application that you will create!\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Try the demo app**](https://chatbot-for-own-data.xs6r134s1i6.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of chatbots, web application development using Flask and Python, and the use of LangChain framework in interpreting and responding to a wide array of user inputs. And most important, you would have built a comprehensive and impressive chatbot application!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you get started, let's look at the key elements you'll be using to build your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Chatbots\n",
    "Chatbots are software applications designed to engage in human-like conversation. They can respond to text inputs from users and are widely used in various domains, including customer service, eCommerce, and education. In this project, you will build a chatbot capable of not only engaging users in a general conversation but also answering queries based on a particular document.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### LangChain\n",
    "LangChain is a versatile tool for building AI-driven language applications. It provides various functionalities such as text retrieval, summarization, translation, and many more, by leveraging pretrained language models. In this project, you will be integrating LangChain into your chatbot, empowering it to understand and respond to diverse user inputs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Flask\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, known for its simplicity and speed. A web framework is a software framework designed to support the development of web applications, including the creation of web servers, and management of HTTP requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use Flask to create the server side or backend of your chatbot. This involves handling incoming messages from users, processing these messages, and sending appropriate responses back to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Routes in Flask\n",
    "Routes are an essential part of web development. When your application receives a request from a client (typically a web browser), it needs to know how to handle that request. This is where routing comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Flask, routes are created using the @app.route decorator to bind a function to a URL route. When a user visits that URL, the associated function is executed. In your chatbot project, you will use routes to handle the POST requests carrying user messages and to process document data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  - CSS - JavaScript\n",
    "You are provided with a ready-to-use chatbot front-end, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures web content, CSS styles it and JavaScript adds interactivity. These technologies create a visually appealing and interactive chatbot interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this project, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explain the basics of Langchain and AI applications\n",
    "* Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python Flask\n",
    "* Implement PDF upload functionality to allow the assistant to comprehend file input from users\n",
    "* Integrate the assistant with open source models to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests\n",
    "* (Optional) Deploy the PDF assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Knowledge of the basics of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python is nice to have but not essential. Each step of the process and code will have a comprehensive explanation in this lab.\n"

    "## Setting up and understanding the user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the goal is to create a chatbot with an interface that allows communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's set up the environment by executing the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install virtualenv \n",
    "virtualenv my_env # create a virtual environment my_env\n",
    "source my_env/bin/activate # activate my_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface will be similar to many chatbots you see and use online. The code for the interface is provided and the focus of this guided project is to connect this interface with the backend that handles the uploading of your custom documents and integrates it with an LLM model to get customized responses. The provided code will help you to understand how the frontend and backend interact, and as you go through it, you will learn about the important parts and how it works, giving you a clear understanding of how the frontend works and how to create this simple web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following commands to retrieve the project, give it an appropriate name, and finally move to that directory by running the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/sinanazeri/build_own_chatbot_without_open_ai.git\n",
    "mv build_own_chatbot_without_open_ai build_chatbot_for_your_data\n",

    "installing the requirements for the project\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a cup of coffee, it will take 5-10 minutes to install the requirements (You can continue this project while the requirements are installed).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section gives a brief understanding of how the frontend works.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n",
    "The `index.html` file is responsible for the layout and structure of the web interface. This file contains the code for incorporating external libraries such as JQuery, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome Icons, and the CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript code (`script.js`) that control the styling and interactivity of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `style.css` file is responsible for customizing the visual appearance of the page's components. It also handles the loading animation using CSS keyframes. Keyframes are a way of defining the values of an animation at various points in time, allowing for a smooth transition between different styles and creating dynamic animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `script.js` file is responsible for the page's interactivity and functionality. It contains the majority of the code and handles all the necessary functions such as switching between light and dark mode, sending messages, and displaying new messages on the screen. It even enables the users to record audio."

    "\n",
    "1. Message processing: The function `processUserMessage(userMessage)` sends a POST request to the server with the user's message and waits for a response. The server processes the message and returns a response that is displayed in the chat window.\n",
    "```\n",
    "const processUserMessage = async (userMessage) => {\n",

    "### Running the application\n",
    "First, in the `server.py` you have the following code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True, port=8000, host='0.0.0.0')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The line `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` checks if the script is being run directly. If so, it starts the Flask application with `app.run(debug=True, port=8000, host='0.0.0.0')`. This starts a web server that listens on port 8000 and is accessible from any IP address (`'0.0.0.0'`). The server runs in debug mode (`debug=True`), which provides detailed error messages and automatically reloads the server when code changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating the Docker container\n",
    "Docker allows for the creation of “containers” that package an application and its dependencies together. This allows the application to run consistently across different environments, as the container includes everything it needs to run. Additionally, using a Docker image to create and run applications can simplify the deployment process, as the image can be easily distributed and run on any machine that has Docker. This easy distribution of image ensures that the application runs in the same way in development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The git clone from the second page already comes with a Dockerfile and requirements.txt for this application. These files are used to build the image with the dependencies already installed. Looking into the Dockerfile you can see it is fairly simple, it just creates a Python environment, moves all the files from the local directory to the container, installs the required packages, and then starts the application by running the python command.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 different containers that need to run simultaneously for the application to run and interact with Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting the application\n",
    "This image is quick to build as the application is quite small. These commands first build the application running the commands in the Dockerfile and provide a tag or name to the built container as build-your-own-chatbot, then run it in the foreground on port 8000. You'll need to run these commands every time you wish to make a new change to one of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker build . -t build_chatbot_for_your_data\n",
    "docker run -p 8000:8000 build_chatbot_for_your_data\n",
