    "## Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to this guided project on creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click here to play with a demo of the final application that you will create!\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of voice assistants and the skills to create your own AI-powered assistant that can communicate through voice input and output. You will also have a strong foundation in web development using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a finished full stack impressive application!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, let's give some context of each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI\n",
    "OpenAI is a research organization that aims to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. One of their key projects is GPT-3, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. You will be using GPT-3 in your assistant to allow it to understand and respond to a wide range of user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM Watson speech libraries for embed\n",
    "IBM Watson® Speech Libraries for Embed are a set of containerized text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries designed to offer our IBM partners greater flexibility to infuse the best of IBM Research® technology into their solutions. Now available as embeddable AI, partners gain greater capabilities to build voice transcription and voice synthesis applications more quickly and deploy them in any hybrid multi-cloud environment. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voice assistants\n",
    "A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (Flask)\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in web development and data science. Flask is a web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. You will be using Python and Flask to build the backend of your voice assistant. Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in projects like yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML - CSS - Javascript\n",
    "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Javascript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive frontend for your assistant. Users will be able to interact with the voice assistant through a web interface that's built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this project, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the basics of voice assistants and their various applications\n",
    "Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript\n",
    "Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users\n",
    "Integrate the assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests\n",
    "Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output\n",
    "Combine all the above components to create a functional assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response\n",
    "(Optional) Deploy the assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience\n",
    "Prerequisites\n",
    "Having knowledge of the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python are nice to have but not essential. We will do our best in explaining each step of the process as well as any code shown along the way."

    "### Step 1: Understanding the interface\n",
    "In this project, the goal is to create an interface that allows communication with a voice assistant, and a backend to manage the sending and receiving of responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend will use HTML, CSS and Javascript with popular libraries such as Bootstrap for basic styling, Font Awesome for icons and JQuery for efficient handling of actions. The user interface will be similar to other voice assistant applications, like Google Assistant. The code for the interface is provided and the focus of the course is on building the voice assistant and integrating it with various services and APIs. The provided code will help you to understand how the frontend and backend interact, and as you go through it, you will learn about the important parts and how it works, giving you a good understanding of how the frontend works and how to create this simple web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following commands to receive the outline of the project, rename it to save it with another name and finally move into that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/arora-r/chatapp-with-voice-and-openai-outline.git\n",
    "mv chatapp-with-voice-and-openai-outline chatapp-with-voice-and-openai\n",
    "cd chatapp-with-voice-and-openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section gives a brief understanding of how the frontend works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML, CSS, and Javascript\n",
    "The `index.html` file is responsible for the layout and structure of the web interface. This file contains the code for incorporating external libraries such as JQuery, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome Icons, as well as the CSS (`style.css`) and Javascript code (`script.js`) that control the styling and interactivity of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `style.css` file is responsible for customizing the visual appearance of the page's components. It also handles the loading animation using CSS keyframes. Keyframes are a way of defining the values of an animation at various points in time, allowing for a smooth transition between different styles and creating dynamic animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `script.js` file is responsible for the page's interactivity and functionality. It contains the majority of the code and handles all the necessary functions such as switching between light and dark mode, sending messages, and displaying new messages on the screen. It even enables the users to record audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images of UI\n",
    "Here are some images of the frontend you received.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Light mode\n",
    "This demonstrates how the base code works. It'll just return null as a response\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dark mode\n",
    "Once you go through the project, you'll complete the assistant and it will be able to give clear responses as shown below:"

    "### Step 2: Understanding the server\n",
    "The server is how the application will run and communicate with all your services. Flask is a web development framework for Python and can be used as a backend for the application. It is a lightweight and simple framework that makes it quick and easy to build web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Flask, you can create web pages and applications without needing to know a lot of complex coding or use additional tools or libraries. You can create your own routes and handle user requests, and it also allows you to connect to external APIs and services to retrieve or send data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guided project uses Flask to handle the backend of your voice assistant. This means that you will be using Flask to create routes and handle HTTP requests and responses. When a user interacts with the voice assistant through the frontend interface, the request will be sent to the Flask backend. Flask will then process the request and send it to the appropriate service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provided gives the outline for the server in the `server.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the file, there are several import statements. These statements are used to bring in external libraries and modules, which will be used in the current file. For instance, `speech_text` is a function inside the `worker.py` file, while `openai` is a package that needs to be installed to use the OpenAI's GPT-3 model. These imported packages, modules and libraries will allow you to access the additional functionalities and methods that they offer, making it easy to interact with the speech-to-text and GPT-3 model in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath the imports, the Flask application is initialized, and a CORS policy is set. A CORS policy is used to allow or prevent web pages from making requests to different domains than the one that served the web page. Currently, it is set to `*` to allow any request.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `server.py` file consists of 3 functions which are defined as routes, and the code to start the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first route is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user tries to load the application, they initially send a request to go to the `/` endpoint. They will then trigger this `index` function above and execute the code above. Currently, the returned code from the function is a render function to show the `index.html` file which is the frontend interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second and third routes are what will be used to process all requests and handle sending information between the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the application is started with the `app.run` command to run on port `8080` and have the host be `0.0.0.0` (a.k.a. `localhost`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next sections will take you through the process of completing the `process_message_route` and `speech_to_text_route` functions in this file and help you understand how to use the packages and endpoints."

    "### Step 3: Running the application\n",
    "Docker allows for the creation of “containers” that package an application and its dependencies together. This allows the application to run consistently across different environments, as the container includes everything it needs to run. Additionally, using a Docker image to create and run applications can simplify the deployment process, as the image can be easily distributed and run on any machine that has Docker installed. This can help to ensure that the application runs in the same way in development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git clone` from Step 1 already comes with a `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` for this application. These files are used to build the image with the dependencies already installed. Looking into the `Dockerfile` you can see its fairly simple, it just creates a python environment, moves all the files from the local directory to the container, installs the required packages, and then starts the application by running the `python` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 different containers need to run simultaneously to have the application run and interact with Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Small prerequisites:\n",
    "You need to run these commands with a single click to fulfill some of the prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir /home/project/chatapp-with-voice-and-openai/certs/\n",
    "cp /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/rootCA.crt /home/project/chatapp-with-voice-and-openai/certs/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Starting the application\n",
    "This image is quick to build as the application is quite small. These commands first build the application (running the commands in the `Dockerfile`) and tags (names) the built container as `voice-chatapp-powered-by-openai`, then runs it in the foreground on `port 8000`. **You'll need to run these commands everytime you wish to make a new change to one of the files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker build . -t voice-chatapp-powered-by-openai\n",
    "docker run -p 8000:8000 voice-chatapp-powered-by-openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The application must be opened on a new tab since the minibrowser in this environment cannot support certain required features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your browser may deny “pop-ups” but please allow them for the new tab to open up.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the application will run but return `null` for any input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've had a chance to run and play around with the application, please press `Crtl` (a.k.a. `control (^)` for Mac) and `C` at the same time to stop the container and continue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application will only run while the container is up. If you make new changes to the files and would like to test them, you will have to rebuild the image.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 4: Integrating Watson Speech-to-Text\n",
    "Speech-to-Text functionality is a technology that converts speech into text using machine learning. It is useful for accessibility, productivity, convenience, multilingual support, and cost-effective solutions for a wide range of applications. For example, being able to take a user's voice as input for a chat application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the embedded Watson Speech-to-Text AI model that was deployed earlier, it is possible to easily convert your speech-to-text by a simple API. This result can then be passed to OpenAI API for generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "You will be updating a function called `speech_to_text` that will take in audio data received from the browser and pass it to the Watson Speech-to-Text API. Open `worker.py` from the explore or by clicking below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to import the requests library at the top of your `worker.py` file. This library is a simple HTTP request library that you will be using to make API calls to the Watson Speech-to-Text API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speech_to_text function will take in audio data as a parameter, make an API call to the Watson Speech-to-Text API using the requests library, and return the transcription of the audio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember to replace the `...` for the `base_url` variable with the URL for your Speech-to-Text model (for example, `https://sn-watson-stt.labs.skills.network`).**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Worker.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "def speech_to_text(audio_binary):\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Set up Watson Speech-to-Text HTTP Api url\n",
    "    base_url = '...'\n",
    "    api_url = base_url+'/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Set up parameters for our HTTP reqeust\n",
    "    params = {\n",
    "        'model': 'en-US_Multimedia',\n",

    "        print('recognised text: ', text)\n",
    "        return text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "The function simply takes `audio_binary` as the only parameter and then sends it in the body of the HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an HTTP Post request to Watson Speech-to-Text API, you need the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **URL** of the API: This is defined as `api_url` in your code and points to the Watson's Speech-to-Text service\n",
    "* **Parameters**: This is defined as params in your code. It's just a dictionary having one key-value pair i.e. `'model': 'en-US_Multimedia'` which simply tells Watson that you want to use the US English model for processing your speech\n",
    "* **Body** of the request: this is defined as `body` and is equal to `audio_binary` since you are sending the audio data inside the body of your POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then use the requests library to send this HTTP request passing in the url, params, and data(body) to it and then use `.json()` to convert the API's response to json format which is very easy to parse and can be treated like a dictionary in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the response is as shown below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"response\": {\n",
    "    \"results\": {\n",
    "      \"alternatives\": {\n",
    "        \"transcript\": \"Recognised text from your speech\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you check if the response contains any results, and if it does, you extract the text by getting the nested transcript string as shown above. Then return this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Small tip**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the print statements such as print(‘response’, response), it's always a good idea to print out the data you are receiving from some external place like an API in this case, as it really helps with debugging if something goes wrong.\n"

    "    return response_text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "The function is really simple, thanks to the very easy to use `openai` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you can give your personal assistant some personality. In this case you are telling the model to become a personal assistant by: `Act like a personal assistant`, and then giving it specific tasks its capable of doing: `You can respond to questions, translate sentences, summarize news, and give recommendations.`. By adding the original user message afterwards, it gives OpenAI more room to sound genuine. Feel free to change this according to what you require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you call OpenAI's API by using `openai.chat.completions.create` function and pass in the following 3 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**model**: This is the OpenAI model we want to use for processing our prompt, in this case we are using their `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.\n",
    "messages: The messages parameter is an array of objects used to define the conversation flow between the user and the AI. Each object represents a message with two key **attributes**: role (identifying the sender as either “system” for setup instructions or “user” for the actual user query) and content (the message text). The “system” role message instructs the AI on how to behave (for example, acting like a personal assistant), while the “user” role message contains the user's input. This structured approach helps tailor the AI's responses to be more relevant and personalized.\n",
    "**max_tokens**: This is the maximum length of the response we are looking for. 30 tokens correspond to roughly 1-2 sentences. Right now, we are setting it to 4000, which is the maximum value of the tokens that this model supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you can definitely tweak these parameters according to your personalized needs and can learn more about them by going to [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground/) where you can test all parameters in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the response is something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"choices\": [\n",
    "      {\"message\": {\n",
    "          content: \"The model\\'s answer to our prompt\",\n",

    "      ...\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, you parse the `openai_response` to extract the answer to your prompt which is `openai_response.choices[0].message.content` and store it in a variable called `response_text`. Finally, you return the `response_text`.\n",

    "    print('text to speech response:', response)\n",
    "    return response.content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "The function simply takes `text` and `voice` as the parameters. It adds voice as a parameter to the `api_url` if it's not empty or not default. It sends the `text` in the body of the HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, as before, to make an HTTP Post request to Watson Text-to-Speech API, you need the following three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **URL** of the API: This is defined as `api_url` in your code and points to Watson's Text to Speech service. This time you also append a voice parameter to the `api_url` if the user has sent a preferred voice in their request.\n",
    "* **Headers**: This is defined as `headers` in your code. It's just a dictionary having two key-value pairs. The first is 'Accept':'audio/wav' which tells Watson that we are sending an audio having wav format. The second one is ‘Content-Type’:’application/json’, which means that the format of the body would be JSON\n",
    "* **Body** of the request: This is defined as `json_data` and is a dictionary containing ‘text’:`text` key-value pair, this text will then be processed and converted to a speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the requests library to send this HTTP request passing in the URL, headers, and json(body) to it and then use .json() to convert the API's response to json format so we can parse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the response is something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"response\": {\n",
    "        content: The Audio data for the processed text to speech\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we return `response.content` which contains the audio data received."

    "### Step 7: Putting everything together by creating Flask API endpoints\n",
    "Now by using the functions we defined in the previous sections; we can connect everything together and complete the assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes in this section will be for the `server.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "he outline has already taken care of the imports for the functions from the `worker.py` file to the `server.py` file. This allows the `server.py` file to access these imported functions from the `worker.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`from worker import speech_to_text, text_to_speech, openai_process_message`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will be updating two Flask routes, one for converting user's speech-to-text (`speech_to_text_route`) and the other for processing their message and converting the OpenAI's response back to speech (`process_message_route`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speech-to-Text route\n",
    "This function is very simple, as it only converts the user's speech-to-text using the `speech_to_text` we defined in one of our previous sections and return the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Code\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route('/speech-to-text', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def speech_to_text_route():\n",
    "    print(\"processing speech-to-text\")\n",
    "    audio_binary = request.data # Get the user's speech from their request\n",

    "    print(response.data)\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "We start off by storing the `request.data` in a variable called `audio_binary`, as we are sending the binary data of audio in the body of the request from the front end. Then we use our previously defined function `speech_to_text` and pass in the `audio_binary` as a parameter to it. We store the return value in a new variable called `text`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our front end expects a JSON response, we create a json response by using the Flask's `app.response_class` function and passing in three arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **response**: This is the actual data that we want to send in the body of our HTTP response. We will be using `json.dumps` function and will pass in a simple dictionary containing only one key-value pair -`'text': text`\n",
    "* **status**: This is the status code of the HTTP response; we will set it to `200` which essentially means the response is `OK` and that the request has succeeded.\n",
    "* **mimetype**: This is the format of our response which is more formally written as `'application/json'` in HTTP request/response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then return the `response`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### message route\n",
    "This function will basically accept a user's message in text form with their preferred voice. It will then use our previously defined helper functions to call the OpenAI's API to process this prompt and then finally convert that response to text using Watson's Text to Speech API and then return this data back to the user.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "We will start by storing user's message in `user_message` by using `request.json['userMessage']`. Similarly, we will also store the user's preferred `voice` in voice by using `request.json['voice']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use the helper function we defined earlier to process this user's message by calling `openai_process_message(user_message)` and storing the response in `openai_response_text`. We will then clean this response to remove any empty lines by using a simple one liner function in python, `os.linesep.join([s for s in openai_response_text.splitlines() if s])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have this response cleaned, we will now use another helper function we defined earlier to convert it to speech. Therefore, we will call `text_to_speech` and pass in the two required parameters which are `openai_response_text` and `voice`. We will store the function's return value in a variable called `openai_response_speech`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the openai_response_speech is a type of audio data, we can't directly send this inside a json as it can only store textual data. Therefore, we will be using something called “base64 encoding”. In simple words, we can convert any type of binary data to a textual representation by encoding the data in base64 format. Hence, we will simply use `base64.b64encode(openai_response_speech).decode('utf-8')` and store the result back to `openai_response_speech`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have everything ready for our response so finally we will be using the same `app.response_class` function and send in the three parameters required. The `status` and `mimetype` will be exactly the same as we defined them in our previous `speech_to_text_route`. In the response, we will use `json.dumps` function as we did before and will pass in a dictionary as a parameter containing `\"openaiResponseText\":openai_response_text` and `\"openaiResponseSpeech\":openai_response_speech`.\n",
