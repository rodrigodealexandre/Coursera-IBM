    "## Integrating your Chatbot into a Web Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn to set up a back-end server and integrate your chatbot into a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up your back-end server\n",
    "* Integrate your chatbot into your Flask server\n",
    "* Communicate with the back-end using a web page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "This section assumes you know how to build the simple terminal chatbot explained in the first lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things you must build to create your ChatGPT-like website:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A back-end server that hosts your chatbot\n",
    "* A front-end webpage that communicates with your back-end server\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Hosting your chatbot on a backend server\n",
    "#### What is a backend server?\n",
    "A backend server is like the brain behind a website or application. In this case, the backend server will receive prompts from your website, feed them into your chatbot, and return the output of the chatbot back to the website, which will be read by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hosting a simple backend server using Flask\n",
    "*Note: Consider using a requirements.txt file*\n",
    "`flask` is a Python framework for building web applications with Python. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to handle incoming requests, process data, and generate responses, making it easy to power your website or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "For all terminal interactions in this lab (such as running python files or installing packages), you will use the built-in terminal that comes with Cloud IDE. You may launch the terminal by either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressing `Ctrl + `` , or\n",
    "* By selecting Terminal â€“> New Terminal from the toolbar at the top of the IDE window on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, let's install the following requisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3.11 -m pip install flask\n",
    "python3.11 -m pip install flask_cors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up the server\n",
    "Next, you will create a script that stores your flask server code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file in the directory `/home/project` by pressing `Ctrl + N` or by clicking 'File -> New File' in the IDE. Name the file `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how to implement a simple flask server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste the above code in the `app.py` file you just created and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.\n",
    "* You create an instance of the `Flask` class and assign it to the variable `app`.\n",
    "* You define a route for the homepage by decorating the `home()` function with the `@app.route()` decorator. The function returns the string `'Hello, World!'`. This means that when the user visits the URL where the website is hosted, the backend server will receive the request and return 'Hello, World!' to the user.\n",
    "* The `if __name__ == '__main__':` condition ensures that the server is only run if the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.\n",
    "* Finally, you call `app.run()` to start the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "`python3.11 app.py`"
