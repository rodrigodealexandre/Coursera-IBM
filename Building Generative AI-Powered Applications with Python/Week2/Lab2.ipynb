    "## Integrating your Chatbot into a Web Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn to set up a back-end server and integrate your chatbot into a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "After completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up your back-end server\n",
    "* Integrate your chatbot into your Flask server\n",
    "* Communicate with the back-end using a web page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "This section assumes you know how to build the simple terminal chatbot explained in the first lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things you must build to create your ChatGPT-like website:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A back-end server that hosts your chatbot\n",
    "* A front-end webpage that communicates with your back-end server\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Hosting your chatbot on a backend server\n",
    "#### What is a backend server?\n",
    "A backend server is like the brain behind a website or application. In this case, the backend server will receive prompts from your website, feed them into your chatbot, and return the output of the chatbot back to the website, which will be read by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hosting a simple backend server using Flask\n",
    "*Note: Consider using a requirements.txt file*\n",
    "`flask` is a Python framework for building web applications with Python. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to handle incoming requests, process data, and generate responses, making it easy to power your website or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "For all terminal interactions in this lab (such as running python files or installing packages), you will use the built-in terminal that comes with Cloud IDE. You may launch the terminal by either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pressing `Ctrl + `` , or\n",
    "* By selecting Terminal –> New Terminal from the toolbar at the top of the IDE window on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, let's install the following requisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3.11 -m pip install flask\n",
    "python3.11 -m pip install flask_cors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up the server\n",
    "Next, you will create a script that stores your flask server code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new file in the directory `/home/project` by pressing `Ctrl + N` or by clicking 'File -> New File' in the IDE. Name the file `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how to implement a simple flask server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Paste the above code in the `app.py` file you just created and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.\n",
    "* You create an instance of the `Flask` class and assign it to the variable `app`.\n",
    "* You define a route for the homepage by decorating the `home()` function with the `@app.route()` decorator. The function returns the string `'Hello, World!'`. This means that when the user visits the URL where the website is hosted, the backend server will receive the request and return 'Hello, World!' to the user.\n",
    "* The `if __name__ == '__main__':` condition ensures that the server is only run if the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.\n",
    "* Finally, you call `app.run()` to start the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "`python3.11 app.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add the following routes to try it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route('/bananas')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'This page has bananas!'\n",
    "    \n",
    "@app.route('/bread')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'This page has bread!'\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Okay - now that you've demonstrated how routes work, you can remove these two routes (bananas and bread) from your `app.py` as you won't be using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, you'll also add two more lines of code to your program to mitigate CORS errors - a type of error related to making requests to domains other than the one that hosts this webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be modifying your code as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "from flask_cors import CORS\t\t# newly added\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "CORS(app)\t\t\t\t# newly added\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating your chatbot into your Flask server\n",
    "Now that you have your Flask server set up, let's integrate your chatbot into your Flask server.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated at the beginning, this lab assumes you've completed the first lab of this guided project on how to create your own simple chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll install the requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "`python3.11 -m pip install transformers torch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s copy the code to initialize your chatbot from lab 1 and place it at the top of your script. You also must import the necessary libraries for your chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n",
    "from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "model_name = \"facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill\"\n",
    "model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n",
    "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n",
    "conversation_history = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll need to import a couple more modules to read the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from flask import request\n",
    "import json\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing the actual function though, you need to determine the structure you expect to receive in the incoming HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define your expected structure as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'prompt': 'message'\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now implement your chatbot function. Again, you'll copy code over from your chatbot implementation from the first lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route('/chatbot', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def handle_prompt():\n",
    "    # Read prompt from HTTP request body\n",
    "    data = request.get_data(as_text=True)\n",

    "    input_text = data['prompt']\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Create conversation history string\n",
    "    history = \"\\n\".join(conversation_history)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Tokenize the input text and history\n",
    "    inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(history, input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Generate the response from the model\n",
    "    outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length= 60)  # max_length will acuse model to crash at some point as history grows\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Decode the response\n",
    "    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True).strip()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Add interaction to conversation history\n",
    "    conversation_history.append(input_text)\n",
    "    conversation_history.append(response)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only new thing you've done uptil now is read the prompt from the HTTP request body. You've copied everything else from your previous chatbot implementation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect, now before testing your application, here's what the final version of your code looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's test your implementation by using `curl` to make a POST request to <HOST>/chatbot with the following request body: {'prompt':'Hello, how are you today?'}.\n",
    "\n",
    "`curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"prompt\": \"Hello, how are you today?\"}' 127.0.0.1:5000/chatbot`\n",
