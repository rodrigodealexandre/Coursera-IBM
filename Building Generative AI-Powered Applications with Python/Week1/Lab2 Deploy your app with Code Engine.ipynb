    "## Deploy your app with Code Engine\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Now that you have Gradio to help you generate a user interface for an application, let's see how you can run applications on IBM Cloud and access it with a public URL using IBM Code Engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "At the end of this project, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a container image\n",
    "* Create the files required to deploy your app in a container\n",
    "* Create your Code Engine project\n",
    "* Build a container image with Code Engine\n",
    "* Deploy a containerized app using Code Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container images and containers\n",
    "Code Engine lets you run your apps in containers on IBM Cloud. A container is an isolated environment or place where an application can run independently. Containers can run anywhere, such as on operating systems, virtual machines, developer's machines, physical servers, and so on. This allows the containerized application to run anywhere as well and the isolation mechanism ensures that the running application will not interfere with the rest of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are created from container images. A container image is basically a snapshot or a blueprint that indicates what will be in a container when it runs. Therefore, to deploy a containerized app, you first need to create the app's container image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the container image\n",
    "The files required to deploy your app in a container are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use the Gradio framework for generating the user interface of the app,for example, the Python script that contains the code to create and launch the gradio.Interface can be named as `demo.py`.\n",
    "* The source code of the app has its dependencies, such as libraries that the code uses. Hence, you need a `requirements.txt` file that specifies all the libraries the source code depends on.\n",
    "* You need a file that shows the container runtime the steps for assembling the container image, named as `Dockerfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create the three files. Open a terminal and while you are in the `home/project` directory, make a new directory `myapp` for storing the files and go into the directory with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "mkdir myapp\n",
    "cd myapp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Step 1: Creating requirements.txt\n",
    "If you are a Data Scientist, you may be familiar with the `pip3 install <library-name>` command for installing libraries. By using a `requirements.txt` file that consists of all libraries you need, you can install all of them into your environment at once with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to deploy the app in a container; thus, all the dependencies need to go into the container as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Make sure you are in the myapp directory and your virtual environment my_env created previously is activated. This allows the libraries to be installed into your virtual environment only.*"

    "\n",
    "**WORKDIR /app**\n",
    "To facilitate the running of your commands, let's create a working directory `/app`. This instructs Docker to use this path as the default location for all subsequent commands.

    "\n",
    "**COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt**\n",
    "Before you run `pip3 install`, you need to get your `requirements.txt` file into your image. You can use the `COPY` command to transfer the contents. The `COPY` command takes two parameters. The first parameter indicates to the Docker what file(s) you would like to copy into the image. The second parameter indicates to the Docker the location where the file(s) need to be copied. You can move the `requirements.txt` file into your working directory /app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RUN pip3 install â€“no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt**\n",
    "Once you have your `requirements.txt` file inside the image, you can use the `RUN` command to execute the command `pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`. This works exactly the same as if you were running the command locally on your machine, but this time the modules are installed into the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**COPY**\n",
    "At this point, you have an image that is based on Python version 3.10 and you have installed your dependencies. The next step is to add your source code to the image. You will use the `COPY` command just like you did with your `requirements.txt` file above to copy everything in your current working directory to the file system in the container image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CMD [\"python\", \"demo.py\"]**\n",
    "Now, you have to indicate to the Docker what command you want to run when your image is executed inside a container. You use the CMD command. Docker will run the `python demo.py` command to launch your app inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that all three files have been created, let's bring in the Code Engine for building the container image."
