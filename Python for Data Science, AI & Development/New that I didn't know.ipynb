    "### Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in R, in pandas you can't directly use `.iloc[]` or `.loc[]` with a mix of integer and label-based indexing for both the rows and columns simultaneously. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using a combination of `.iloc[]` and `.loc[]`, or by using `.loc[]` with boolean indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Combination of `.iloc[]` and `.loc[]`:** You can use `.iloc[]` to select the row by index and then use `.loc[]` to select the column by label.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `df2.loc[df2.index[3], \"Department\"]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  **Using `.loc[]` with boolean indexing:** You can use boolean indexing to select rows and columns based on conditions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    `df2.loc[df2.index[3], \"Department\"]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these approaches will allow you to select a specific cell in your DataFrame, even if it contains a mix of text and numbers and you want to index using both integer and label-based indices\n",
    "\n",
    "Also In Python, specifically in pandas, when using `.iloc[]` to select rows or columns by index, you can't leave an index empty. In contrast, R allows specifying a range without specifying the start or end index, assuming it to be the beginning or end, respectively. However, in Python, you must explicitly provide both the start and end index in a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select a range of rows or columns using `.iloc[]`, you need to specify both the start and end indices. Here's the correct syntax to select all rows with only the 2nd column:\n",
    "`df2.iloc[:, 2:3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax selects all rows (`:` denotes all rows) and the column at index 2 (Python uses 0-based indexing). The range `2:3` specifies the column indices from 2 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive), so it selects only the 2nd column.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to select all rows with only the 2nd column using label-based indexing, you can use `.loc[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, when using indexing or selecting specific elements from a DataFrame, the convention is to specify rows first and then columns. This is the opposite of the convention used in R. If you prefer the R-style indexing (column-first), you can achieve similar behavior in pandas by using the `df.iloc[]` or `df.loc[]` accessors with a list of column names followed by a row index, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Using iloc with column names and row index \n",
    "value = df.iloc[:, ['column1', 'column2']].iloc[3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
